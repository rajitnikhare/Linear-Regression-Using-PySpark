# Linear Regression project using PySpark

Data has been taken from UC Irvine Machine Learning repository. It is a description of Ship carriers and the related parameters which includes: 

    1. Ship Name
    
    2. Cruise Line
    
    3. Age of the ship
    
    4. Tonnage
    
    5. Passenger Capacity
    
    6. Length
    
    7. Number of Cabins
    
    8. Passenger Density
    
    9. Crew (Target Variable)

I would be using PySpark and Machine Learning to predict our target variable, Crew.
