# Linear Regression project using PySpark

Data has been taken from UC Irvine Machine Learning repository. It is a description of Ship carriers and the related parameters which includes: 
    * Ship Name
    * Cruise Line
    * Age of the ship
    * Tonnage
    * Passanger Capacity
    * Length
    * Number of Cabins
    * Passenger Density
    * Crew (Target Variable)

I would be using PySpark and Machine Learning to predict our target variable, Crew.
